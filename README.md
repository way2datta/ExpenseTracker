This is a simple expense tracker application using asp.net mvc.
I have created it for students demo.

Database script is present at https://github.com/way2datta/ExpenseTracker/blob/master/mvc-app/BeingDK.ExpenseTracker.Web.FrontEnd/Setup/ExpenseTracker.sql

It has scope for improvement.
You could add hashed password functionality in it.

You could add repository pattern in it.

You could extract logic to fill created_at and updated_at dates.

You could modify themes.

You bundle and minify the stuff.

You could move server side logic like graph generation to client side.

You could enable the client side validations.

You could add toast message for notifications.

You could slowly replace html parts with react js or other client side js components.

You could add unit tests for some of the functionalities.

You could add loggers to log the errors.

You could handle contraints like Category already exists.

You could do many more...

Feel free to clone and enhance the functionality.
